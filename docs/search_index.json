To expedite data reconciliation steps we choose to rely as much as possible on FAO RIGA-H cross-country harmonized household-level database. RIGA expenditure and income aggregates are used to estimate both farm and crop sales and farm vs. non-farm income. We also include additional household-level variables available through IFPRI replication datasets. Below is a full codebook.

Krausova, &amp; Winters (2007) for a complete documentation): All aggregates are estimated at the household level. All income and expenditures are annualized. All income components are net of costs. Purchases and sales of durable goods, investments and windfall gains are excluded from household income and expenditure calculations since these are not transactions undertaken regularly by households and can result in the significant over- or under-stating of permanent income. All aggregates are reported in local currency (LCU). For each survey, only the rural sample is used (this does not seem consistent across all surveys) An outlier check is imposed after the construction of all income aggregates to deal with extreme income shares that arise following the aggregation of all income components. After estimating the shares of the seven principal income categories (agricultural wages, non-agricultural wages, crop, livestock, self employment, transfer and other) observations with shares greater than or less than 3 (indicating a percentage share of +/- 300%) are dropped from the aggregate. However because RIGA income aggregates are net of costs, we construct intermediary components: \\(cropsales\\) is derived/imputed from RIGA \\(totcropsold\\) \\(cropvalue\\) is derived/imputed from RIGA \\(totcropprod\\) \\(cropsales\\_sh\\) (but can also be derived from RIGA \\(totcropsold\\), \\(shcropsold\\), or \\(shagprodsold\\)) \\[ cropsales\\_sh = \\frac{cropsales}{cropvalue} \\] \\(agsales\\) is derived/imputed from RIGA \\(totagsold\\) \\(agsales\\_sh\\) \\[ agsales\\_sh = \\frac{agsales}{totagprod} \\] \\(aggross = totagprod + farmrntimp + agr\\_wge (+ selfimp1)\\) \\(naggross = transfersgrossimp + otherincimp + nonfarmrntimp + nonagr\\_wge + selfemp\\) \\(totgross = aggross + naggross\\) \\(aggross\\_sh\\) \\[ aggross\\_sh = \\frac{aggross}{totgross} \\] RIGA-H does not provide annual cultivated area, instead we have measures of land owned, land rented out, and land under sharecropping. 1.3 Survey Maps In addition to reconciling household-level micro data, we also construct (approximate) district-level administrative maps for all survey waves. Survey maps and household variables may be linked using attributes svyCode, svyL1Cd, and svyL2Cd (the combination of these 3 attributes always identifies a unique district). The current maps are: Tab. 1.1: Constructed Survey Maps (in progress) Survey Regions Districts tza-nps-2012 8 26 eth-ess-2013 11 79 eth-erss-2011 11 710 gha-glss6 10 170 gha-glss5 10 110 1.4 Agricultural Potential Quadrants In the delineation of farm segments we construct areas of high and low agricultural potential. These areas are obtained by combining areas of high/low agricultural suitability (FAO/GAEZ 2007) with high/low market access (IFPRI 2016). These input maps and the resulting quadrants are shown here.

The ERSS 2011/12 sample is designed to be representative of rural and small town areas of Ethiopia. It is a sub-sample of the 2011/2012 Agricultural Sample Survey (AgSS). The small town sample comes from the universe of small town EAs. The ERSS sample size provides estimates at the national level for rural and small town households. At the regional level, it provides estimates for four regions including Amhara, Oromiya, SNNP, and Tigray. The sample is a two-stage probability sample. The first stage of sampling entailed selecting primary sampling units, which are a sample of the CSA enumeration areas (EAs). For the rural sample, 290 EAs were selected from the AgSS EAs. The AgSS EAs were selected based on probability proportional to size of the total EAs in each region. For small town EAs, a total of 43 EAs were selected. In order to ensure sufficient sample in the most populous regions (Amhara, Oromiya, SNNP, and Tigray), quotas were set for the number of EAs in each region. The sample is not representative for each of the small regions including Afar, Benshangul Gumuz, Dire Dawa, Gambella, Harari, and Somali regions. However, estimates can be produced for a combination of all smaller regions as one “other regions” category. The 2nd wave ESS 2013/14 adds samples from large town areas. The population frame for the urban expansion consists of all households in towns with population greater than 10,000 people. This population cut off of 10,000 people is the same threshold that is used to define small towns. This wave is nationally representative. The existing panel data (2011/12-2013/14) is only for rural and small towns. The ESS sample size provides estimates at the national level for rural and small town households. At the regional level, it provides estimates for five regions including Addis Ababa, Amhara, Oromiya, SNNP, Tigray, and “other regions”. Note that FAO RIGA-H database is not yet available for ESS Wave 3 (as of Nov 8, 2017). 2.1 Household Sampling and Stratification Tab. 2.1: Composition of Ethiopia ESS Harmonized Survey Samples Survey Regions Districts Sample Rural Urban Farm hhlds Rural (pct) Urban (pct) Farm hhlds (pct) eth-ess-2013 11 102 5,128 3,211 1,917 3,750 63 37 73 eth-erss-2011 10 81 3,969 3,466 503 3,513 87 13 89 Fig. 2.1: (Appoximate) Household Locations and Stratification across Survey Waves, Ethiopia Tab. 2.2: Attrition of Households across Panels, Ethiopia Survey 1 visit 2 visits 2013/14 1,473 3,655 2011/12 314 3,655 Out of the 3,969 households recorded in the 2011 ERSS 3,655 households were re-visited in all 2 waves, while 1,473 out of 5,128 households in the second ESS 2013 sample were only interviewed once. This is due to attrition and tracking of split households across waves. 2.2 Distribution of Farm Holdings across Farm Sizes and Farm Types The plots below show the distribution of key variables in the unweighted sample of households across survey waves.

In contrast to the latest 2 waves GLSS4 is only representative for 3 (ecology) x 2 (rural/urban) zones. GLSS surveys collect information on the demographic characteristics of the population, their education, health, employment and time use, migration, housing conditions and household agriculture, with a specific focus on labor force, with a labor force module expanded in GLSS6 to include a section on child labor. 3.1 Household Sampling and Stratification Tab. 3.1: Composition of Ghana GLSS Harmonized Survey Samples Survey Year Regions Districts Sample Urban Rural GLSS4 1997/98 10 102 5,998 2,199 3,799 GLSS5 2005/06 10 110 8,687 3,618 5,069 GLSS6 2012/13 10 170 16,772 7,445 9,327 3.2 Distribution of Farm Holdings across Farm Sizes and Farm Types The plots below show the distribution of key variables in the unweighted sample of households across survey waves.

["tanzania.html", "Section 4 Tanzania 4.1 Household Sampling and Stratification 4.2 Distribution of Farm Holdings across Farm Sizes and Farm Types 4.3 Farm Segmentation along Farm Types (5-class) and Agricultural Potential Quadrants", " Section 4 Tanzania Relevant sources of household-level micro records for Tanzania include the last 4 rounds of LSMS-ISA National Panel Surveys, 2007 National Sample Census of Agriculture, and 2012 Population and Housing Census: 2007/2008 National Sample Census of Agriculture (NSCA) – small-holder questionnaire covers household information, land ownership/tenure, land use, crop production and marketing, use of credit for agricultural purposes, livestock, investment activities and services and core poverty indicators. The data were collected from a sample of 52,635 rural households (incl. mainland and Zanzibar). 2012 Population and Housing Census (PHC) – only summary report and tables are available 2008/2009 NPS Panel, Wave 1 – a sample of 3,265 households spanning all regions and all districts of Tanzania, both mainland and Zanzibar. The sample is sufficient to produce national estimates of poverty, agricultural production and other key indicators. It is also possible to produce estimates for 4 strata: 1) Dar es Salaam, 2) other urban areas on mainland Tanzania, 3) rural mainland Tanzania, and 4) Zanzibar, and/or across 7 zones (as used in the DHS). These are: North, Central, Eastern, South, Southern Highlands, West and Lake. Due to the limits of the sample size it is typically not possible to produce reliable statistics at the regional or district level. 2010-2011 NPS Panel, Wave 2 – the sample design for the second round of the NPS revisits all the households interviewed in the first round, as well as tracking adult split-off household members. The original sample size of 3,265 households was designed to be representative at the national, urban/rural, and major agro-ecological zones. The total sample size was 3,265 households in 409 EAs (2,063 households in rural areas and 1,202 urban areas). 2012/2013 NPS Panel, Wave 3 – the sample design includes the originally sampled 3,265 households plus split-off households added into the sample in the second round of the NPS. Thus the total sample at the onset of the NPS 2012/2013 consisted of 3,924 target households. 2014/2015, NPS Panel, Wave 4 – in all 4 panels the sample design allows analysis at 4 primary domains of inference and 7 zones. The sample design is a stratified two-stage design. The design consists of 51 design strata corresponding to a rural/urban designation for each of the 26 regions. Wave 4 sample design consists of a new selection of 3,360 households corresponding to 420 EAs from the 2012 PHC. This new cohort in NPS 2014/2015 will be maintained and tracked in all future rounds between national censuses. Note that FAO RIGA-H database is not yet available for NPS Wave 4 (as of Oct 30, 2017). 4.1 Household Sampling and Stratification Tab. 4.1: Composition of Tanzania NPS Harmonized Survey Samples Survey Regions Districts Sample Population Rural Urban Farm hhlds Rural (pct) Urban (pct) Farm hhlds (pct) tza-nps-2008 26 126 3,255 7,227,306 5,316,724 1,910,581 2,426 74 26 75 tza-nps-2010 26 129 3,913 8,872,894 6,132,042 2,740,851 2,677 69 31 68 tza-nps-2012 26 132 4,995 9,339,428 6,387,735 2,951,693 3,377 68 32 68 The first round of the NPS sample is a multi-stage clustered sample design. First stage sampling involves the selection of survey clusters with the probability of selection proportional to cluster size within a stratum. The sampling of these clusters is stratified along two dimensions: 8 administrative zones (seven on Mainland Tanzania plus Zanzibar as an eighth zone), and rural vs. urban clusters within each administrative zone. The combination of these two dimensions yields 16 strata (note that this stratification strategy was modifed in NPS Wave 5 with 51 strata).

This is due to attrition and tracking of split households across waves. 4.2 Distribution of Farm Holdings across Farm Sizes and Farm Types The plots below show the distribution of key variables in the unweighted sample of households across survey waves. The median line is in red, mean line in green, and the blue region is the inferred 95% confidence interval of the mean. 4.2.1 Land Holding Fig. 4.2: Trends in Farm Sizes across Survey Waves (ha) Fig. 4.2: Trends in Farm Sizes across Survey Waves (ha) 4.2.2 Trends in Commercialization Fig. 4.3: Crop Commercialization across Survey Waves (percent of crop production) Fig. 4.4: Agricultural Commercialization across Survey Waves (percent of ag. production) 4.2.3 Trends in Income Diversification The shares of farm and non-farm income are derived from RIGA components, namely: aggross = totagprod + farmrntimp + agr_wge+ ifelse(selfimp1 &lt; 0, NA, selfimp1) naggross = transfersgrossimp + otherincimp + nonfarmrntimp + nonagr_wge + ifelse(selfemp &lt; 0, NA, selfemp) Fig. 4.5: Non-Farm Income (percent of gross income) 4.2.4 3x3 Farm Classification Fig. 4.6: Est.
