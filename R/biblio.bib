                  analytical techniques in a wide range of disciplines in the natural
                  and social sciences. In the R package GWmodel we present techniques
                  from a particular branch of spatial statistics, termed
                  geographically weighted (GW) models. GW models suit situations when
                  data are not described well by some global model, but where there
                  are spatial regions where a suitably localized calibration provides
                  a better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting
                  technique, where localized models are found at target
                  locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool
                  into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. Currently,
                  GWmodel includes functions for: GW summary statistics, GW principal
                  components analysis, GW regression, and GW discriminant analysis;
                  some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.}},
